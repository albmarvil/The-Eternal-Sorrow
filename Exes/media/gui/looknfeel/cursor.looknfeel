    cursor.looknfeel by Paul D. Turner

    This looknfeel specifies a set of WidgetLook definitions that are intended
    to recreate the overall look of Ogre's new SDK tray system within CEGUI.
    
    This looknfeel has been made for use in some upcoming recreations of the
    Ogre samples, that use CEGUI instead of the new Ogre SDK tray system.  This
    is being done mostly for fun, though also to demonstrate the use of CEGUI
    with Ogre.
